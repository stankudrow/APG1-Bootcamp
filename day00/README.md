# APG1 Day00

Go Language Bootcamp/Piscine - Day00

## How-tos

Change the root directory to the "src/ex00", e.g., `cd src/ex00`.

Building the project with `go build` will produce the "ex00" executable file.
You can run the latter just specifying the path to it.

Running the program without building is achievable with `go run main.go`.
See the [usage](#usage) section for the available flags to pass into the program.

The command `go test tests/*.go` will run the unit tests.

## Usage

The numbers are given from the system standard input stream.
To stop the input, you may press Ctrl+D or any combination alike.

The program has the CLI (command-line interface).
The help is printable via the `--help` flag.
